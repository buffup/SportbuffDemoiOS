SportBuff iOS Sample Application

This is a very basic Sample Application that shows how to integrate the SportBuff SDK into your iOS Project.
This project uses Cocoapods to add the SDK, but you can also use SPM instead.

**To use SPM, just add the package from this source: https://github.com/buffup/sportbuff-ios-spm.git**

The project has one ViewController that plays a video using the AVPlayer and add's the SportBuff UI over the player./
Please make sure to replace the **clientName** and update the **streamId** or **providerId** properties when you try it on your own account.
